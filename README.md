This project is an end-to-end **Machine Learning deployment** using **Flask**, designed to take user input through a web form, process the data using a **pre-trained model and preprocessing pipeline**, and return predictions.

It also includes:

-  Modular architecture (`utils.py`, `pipeline`, `exception`)
-  Model artifact loading via `.pkl` files
-  Custom exception handling for traceable error logs
